Add this to your golf ball shag bag, and it will count the balls as you collect them.
Should run a long time on 2 AA batteries.  One button control - press to display the
ball count, and hold for 2 seconds to reset it.

The golf ball sensor is flexible, you can use a reed switch with a magnet, or a
microswitch, or something else that will reset the processor when a ball is detected.
